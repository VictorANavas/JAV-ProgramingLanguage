JAV 
-
Programing language for kids focusing in mathematical development 

_________
Overview
-----------------------------------------------------
______________________________________

Thanks for choosing our language for your early coding journey. 
Every young developer must have a basic foundation to start their career. 
Our goal is to teach the younger kids how to write and understand the basics of programing for them to start developing.


Our language is functional and it specializes in mathematics.
There are many other languages that can be used for mathematical purposes such has MatLab and Julia but this language specialises in the following mathematical topics.
Algebra, trigonometry, Pre-calculus.

The main target for this language are the children in middle school who are interested in coding and like math.
We created a basic syntax because it will make our code more manageable for children who are starting their coding experience.
JAV is capable of calculating the basic arithmetic operations and is able to manage different data types at once.
It has other features available such has number comparison and trigonometric functions.
Other tools available are conditions for the more advance students that are willing to step their experience a lot further.


The group experience was very satisfiying since we learned to program in Python and it was an enriching proyect. Also we learned about the libraries PLY an math which are the ones used in the proyect besides system and are all very usefull. Here is the example repository for PLY (https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) its the one we used as example for the proyect. The PLY official page is (https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn22)
